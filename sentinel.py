    create(name, mro=(object,), cls_dict=None, ...) -> Sentinel instance

    Creates a new sentinel instance. This is a singleton instance kind
    of like the builtin None, and Ellipsis.

    Method resolution order (MRO) for the anonymous class can be
    specified (i.e., it can be a subclass). Provide the mro as tuple of
    all classes that it inherits from. If only one class, provide a
    1-tuple: e.g., (Cls,).

    Additionally extra class attributes, such as methods can be provided
    in the cls_dict dict. The following methods are provided, but
    can be overridden:

        __repr__()
            Returns the class name, similar to None and Ellipsis.
        __copy__()
        __deepcopy__()
            Always return the same singleton instance such that
            ``copy(Sentinel) is Sentinel`` is true.
        __reduce__()
            Provided for proper pickling prowess. That is,
            ``pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(Sentinel)) is Sentinel`` is
            true.

    Finally, the remain arguments and keyword arguments are passed to
    the super class's __init__().  This is helpful when for
    instantiating base classes such as a tuple.
